## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Running

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmekaIwuagwu/1971assignment.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the Project Directory

```bash
cd 1971assignment
```

### 3. Install Required Python Packages

Make sure you have a Python virtual environment active, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up PostgreSQL

Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection URI in your `.env` or directly in your `database.py` or `app.py` (depending on where DB config is located).

Example URI:
```bash
postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/employees_db
```

## üì¨ GraphQL Playground

Once the server is running, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/graphql
```

There, you can interact with your API using the GraphQL Playground UI.
